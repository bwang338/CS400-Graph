Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
I made a beginning level JavaFX for the front end interface that people will be
able to interact with. It doesn't have a whole lot of functionality right now,
but I was just playing around with different kinds of interfaces and found JavaFX
to work really well. The only thing it has right now is 2 buttons. The file was 
called "UserInterface.java"


Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
Updated my JavaFX Front-end interface to look a little nicer and have a tiny bit more functionality
Haven't tied in any of the back-end/data wrangler thing yet, but I have a good idea of how it's going to 
fit in. I also updated the MakeFile to make it easier to test my front end without having to use a webpage
just by creating a .png

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
Completed the FrontEnd.java file that is working synonymously with David's flightfinder.java file to create a working homepage.

Files written by me:
--------------------
<List ALL of the source files here that were written by you. Note that each of the
